# SearchBarIssue

I have a `UICollectionView` in red.

When I start to perform searching by entering the 1st character, I expect the result view controller (in yellow) will cover the entire `UICollectionView`.

It should not cover the top navigation bar.

But seems like this is not the case. May I know why?
